# Bunker

A package containing small utilities for general use in apps.

Bunker is designed to include small utilities that I use on a regular basis. Some code stems from the
original GBMKUtils package, while other code stems from stuff I've written in the past but didn't feel
was appropriate for that package.

## Getting started

Bunker can be added to any Xcode project through the Swift Package Manager in Xcode, or it can be built
from source and added externally.

### Building from source

To build Bunker, you will need the following tools:
- Xcode 12 or later
- Swift 5.6 or later (bundled with Xcode 13 and/or macOS 12 SDKs)

Clone the repository from GitHub using `git clone` or `gh repo clone`, and then open the project in Xcode
to build normally. Alternatively, run the `swift build` command inside of the root directory of the 
repository to build it.
